Project:: FindUrstuff(205112025-Roohee Lodi)
Note: I have not connected to the database, so kindly open two different web page named as index.php and login.php... I have done only Front-end part

Problem:
If we have lost something in nitt then it is very difficult to find something or vice versa. so i am created a website which helps you to find your stuff.

Process:
first, you need to login with your webmail id and password(This will work if my site is on nitt server) so manually i hav created user and password which is realed to DB as DB is not connected for information, so it wont work right now.

Second, index.php - this page is for registration, if you have lost or found something
